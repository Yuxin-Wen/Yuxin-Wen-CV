I am a Researcher on the Tencent Hunyuan team, specializing in the animation of 3D digital humans.

I joined Tencent in 2022, initially with Tencent AI Lab. Previously, I earned my Ph.D. from the Gorilla Lab at South China University of Technology (SCUT), advised by Prof. [Kui Jia](http://kuijia.site).

My research interests lie in computer vision, with a focus on non-Euclidean data, and machine learning.

We are seeking motivated research interns for multimodal research at Tencent Hunyuan in Shenzhen. If interested, please send your CV to rexwen@tencent.com.
