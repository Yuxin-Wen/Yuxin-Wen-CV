I am a Ph.D candidate in the fourth year of a five-year educational system in Geometric Perception and Intelligence Research (Gorilla) Lab @SCUT, under the supervision by Prof. [Kui Jia](http://kuijia.site). My research interests are in computer vision (to non-Euclidean data) and machine learning, with focus on robustness and generalization analysis of deep neural networks, and deep learning shape modeling and reconstruction of objects and scenes.
